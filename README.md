# Personal-Dictionary
This is your personal dictionary which you can use to store bits and pieces like some links, some useful info form a meeting, some important text you found on a website or whatever you think is important for you!


This dictionary is powered by database hence this dictionary will come with all the goodness of it. Since this is bare minimum infrastructure hence it have very basic functionality like add and fetch word. The GUI is also very very basic. As this project progresses and more people gets involved we can turn this into a very useful little software :-)



# How to use?

Just download the "Personal Dictionary" Folder and run the "personal_dictionary.bat" file if you are running windows. Otherwise run "personal_dictionary.py" file with python.


As I said, this is a bare minimum infrastructure hence not professional. It will grow with time and your contributions to the code.
I'm using this bare minimum infra and finding it useful. You may also find it useful. Please come along and help me building this.

Thanks
